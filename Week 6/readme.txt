# Calculate the square root of a number using Newtons method

user inputs a number

create a function using def 
 
Set x equal to n at the start
     
count the number of loop iterations
     
Execute Newton's formula
        
Check if answer is less than 1

Break out of the loop if answer is less than 1

Update root and perform another iteration if answer is greater than 1 
         
return root and print the answer
