This program reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains
# Count the number of E's and e's in a text file

I assume you want Uppercase E's and lowercase e's

Import the fileinput and re libraries

Initialise the counter variable.Set it to zero

Use a for loop to count the number of e's in each line of the text file

I got the for loop from this link :
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7439145/i-want-to-read-in-a-file-from-the-command-line-in-python

find all of the e's in each line

Update the variable after each iteration of the loop

When you reach the end of the file, print the answer.
