Research for Week 2 : https://realpython.com/python-sum-function/

Task for Week 3 accounts.py
Research : https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp

import math module
User inputs a 10 digit account number via the command line  
create a variable to measure the length of the number
print the answer to the command line
print X's and the last 4 digits

#Week 4 Assignment
Research : https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp

user inputs a number. Number variable created.
create a while loop
loop keeps going while the number is greater than 1
if the number is divided 2 with remainder equal to zero
print even number
Divide by 2 and update the variable 
else if the number is divided 2 with remainder not equal to zero
print odd number 
Multiply by 3 and update the variable

Week Task 6 : Calculate the square root of a number using Newtons method 
 
Research : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70793490/how-do-i-calculate-square-root-in-python

user inputs a number
create a function using def 
Set x equal to n at the start
count the number of loop iterations     
Execute Newton's formula        
Check if answer is less than 1
Break out of the loop if answer is less than 1
Update root and perform another iteration if answer is greater than 1          
return root and print the answer


Week 7 : This program reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains

Research
I got the for loop from this link :
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7439145/i-want-to-read-in-a-file-from-the-command-line-in-python

I assume you want Uppercase E's and lowercase e's
Import the fileinput and re libraries
Initialise the counter variable.Set it to zero
Use a for loop to count the number of e's in each line of the text file
find all of the e's in each line
Update the variable after each iteration of the loop
When you reach the end of the file, print the answer.

WEEK 8 TASK : Plotting a function and histogram
