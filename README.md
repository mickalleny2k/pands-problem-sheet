Week Task 6 : Calculate the square root of a number using Newtons method
user inputs a number
create a function using def 
Set x equal to n at the start
count the number of loop iterations     
Execute Newton's formula        
Check if answer is less than 1
Break out of the loop if answer is less than 1
Update root and perform another iteration if answer is greater than 1          
return root and print the answer


Week 7 : This program reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains

Research
I got the for loop from this link :
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7439145/i-want-to-read-in-a-file-from-the-command-line-in-python

I assume you want Uppercase E's and lowercase e's

Import the fileinput and re libraries

Initialise the counter variable.Set it to zero

Use a for loop to count the number of e's in each line of the text file

find all of the e's in each line

Update the variable after each iteration of the loop

When you reach the end of the file, print the answer.
